Wikipedia is the largest and most widely used encyclopedia and it contains more than 33 million articles in many languages. There are more than 4 million articles in the English language itself. Although Wikipedia aims to be the encyclopedia ‘anyone can edit’ but in reality, it is not always true. According to a survey more than 80% of wikipedians are men. With such an important role Wikipedia has in this digital information age but dominated only by a certain group of people is very unhealthy and potentially post disadvantage toward underrepresented populations such as women or people of color.

The fact that there is a huge gender gap in terms of who controls information is a major issue among the Wikipedia community. The gender gap among contributors has led to biased content. There has been much strong evidence that supports Wikipedia’s coverage of the topic is gendered bias. In particular, some popular media have emphasized this concern where Wikipedia has less information about females than male public figures, writers, and scientists. For instance, in 2008 a female Nobel prize winner didn’t have a Wikipedia page. 
                    
**The aim of this project is to dig deeper into wikipedia community gender bias.** Sometimes, we find that there is gender bias when it comes to specific gender discussion where women are more often associated with bodies and appearance and men with their professional competence or intellectual skills.
